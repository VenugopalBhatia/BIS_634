Lack of knowledge and awareness about pharmacovigilance and reporting ADRs among HCPs may contribute to underreporting. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and perception of HCPs regarding ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance in a tertiary care teaching hospital in, Nepal. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. A questionnaire was distributed to 215 HCPs (medical doctors, nurses, and pharmacists) between March and September 2018. Knowledge and perception regarding ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance were studied. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York). Results: The HCPs included 75 medical doctors, 126 nurses, and 14 pharmacists. Majority of the participants were female (67%), and the majority of participants were not aware of pharmacovigilance. Among the participants, pharmacists were found to have better knowledge regarding pharmacovigilance. However, other HCPs (doctors and nurses) strongly agreed about the necessity of having adequate knowledge about pharmacovigilance. Out of 215, 57.7% agreed that the important benefit of reporting ADR was to identify safe drugs and improve patient safety.

These fatty acids are precursors of longer chain fatty acids, arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4 n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3), and eicosatrienoic acid (Mead acid, 20:3 n-9), respectively.8 AA and Mead acid have more proinflammatory properties than EPA.6 Prolonged use of SO emulsions in PN has been associated with hypertriglyceridemia, proinflammatory profile, and PNALD.5,6 As a result, different lipid formulations have been developed. For instance, olive oil (OO) has been added to reduce the amount of SO in lipid emulsions for PN.9 OO is the main source of lipid in the Mediterranean diet, consisting of monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid (18:1 n-9), phenolic compounds, and squalene.10 Diets enriched with OO have been linked to health benefits such as prevention of cancer, heart disease, and aging through its antioxidant properties.10 Compared with pure SO emulsion in PN, a mixture of 80% OO/20% SO has been shown to have some clinical benefits, despite the concern about the increase in Mead acid levels in OO enriched lipid emulsions.6 Another lipid has been used to reduce the level SO component in lipid emulsions for PN was medium chain triglycerides (MCT), containing fatty acids of 6 to 12 carbon atoms.11 Unlike long chain triglycerides (LCT) with fatty acid chains ranging from 14 to 21 carbon atoms, MCT are more water soluble and readily oxidized in the mitochondria for the production of energy.11 A mixture of 50% MCT/50% LCT has been developed and considered to be safe and tolerable in patients requiring PN.12 However, the beneficial effects of MCT/LCT compared with other lipid emulsions for PN remains unclear.6 Fish oil (FO) has lately been considered as an ideal choice of lipid to partially or completely replace SO.6 FO has a high content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (20% to 40%), particularly EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3),13 which have been shown to reduce inflammation by competing with AA for eicosanoid synthesis, producing the 3-series of prostaglandins and thromboxanes and the 5-series of leukotrienes.6 Mixed-oil containing FO for use in PN such as SO/MCT/OO/FO (30%/30%/25%/15%) or MCT/SO/FO (50%/40%/10%) has been recently developed and is available for PN use.6 From small-scale clinical trials, fish oil enriched PN appears to have some clinical benefits compared with non-fish oil enriched PN.4,14 In a recent CADTH report,15 published in 2017, entitled \u201cLipid Formulations for Patients Requiring Parenteral Nutrition: A Review of Clinical and Cost-Effectiveness and Guidelines\u201d, low quality evidence found no difference in comparative clinical effectiveness among lipid emulsions examined in preterm infants.

Methods and analysis: In this single-arm prospective feasibility study, cancer survivors (n=40) will undergo a 10-week multi-modal exercise programme. The study population will comprise of cancer survivors attending outpatient services in an Irish national cancer centre. Participants will be aged 18 or older and have completed treatment with curative intent. Feasibility will be evaluated in terms of recruitment, adherence and compliance to the programme. Secondary outcomes will examine physical function and quality of life measures. In addition, the acceptability of the programme will be assessed through stakeholder feedback. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval through the St. James's Hospital and Tallaght University Hospital Research and Ethics Committee is currently pending. The study results will be used to optimise the intervention content and may serve as the foundation for a larger definitive trial. Results will be disseminated through peer-review journals, congresses and relevant clinical groups.

Here we construct a theoretical model based on describing cell layer as a nemato-elastic medium, by which the cell polarization, cell alignment and cell active contraction are explicitly expressed as functions of components of the nematic order parameter. To determine the order parameter we derive two sets of governing equations, one for the force equilibrium of the system, and the other for the minimization of the system's free energy including the energy of cell polarization and alignment. By solving these coupled governing equations, we can predict the effects of substrate stiffness, geometries of cell layers, external forces and myosin activity on the direction- and position-dependent cell aspect ratio and cell orientation. Moreover, the axisymmetric problem with cells on a ring-like pattern is solved analytically, and the analytical solution for cell aspect ratio are governed by parameter groups which include the stiffness of the cell and the substrate, the strength of myosin activity and the external forces. Our predictions of the cell aspect ratio and orientation are generally comparable to experimental observations. These results show that the pattern of cell polarization is determined by the anisotropic degree of active contractile stress, and suggest a stress-driven polarization mechanism that enables cells to sense their spatial positions to develop direction- and position-dependent behavior.

However, it is still challenging to encapsulate theranostic agents that have different physicochemical properties in a single nanocarrier system because of the immiscibility between the hydrophobic fluorescent molecule and the hydrophilic drug molecule. Thus, we report a novel concept of a theranostic nanoparticle (NP) consisting of an amphiphilic near-infrared (NIR) dye as a hydrophilic drug delivery carrier with enhanced NIR imaging capability. Unlike conventional nanocarrier systems, the newly designed amphiphilic NIR dyes (Cy-C dyes) function as both the drug delivery carrier and the fluorescent imaging agent. It can be utilized for therapy and diagnosis simultaneously by simply encapsulating the hydrophilic drug. This method is innovative not only due to formation of the theranostic nanoparticle for immiscible hydrophilic drug delivery but also because of generation of strong fluorescence signals due to the Cy-C dyes on the surfaces of the NPs. In this study, Cy-C (C = C3, C6, and C9) dyes were designed by conjugating the heptamethine cyanine dye with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG5K) and polyethyleneimine 2000 (PEI2K). The result was self-assembled structures that effectively encapsulated a hydrophilic drug molecule (MTX) without self-quenching and scattered light interference. Among the Cy-C NPs encapsulating MTX (Cy-C/MTX NPs), Cy-C6/MTX and Cy-C9/MTX formed a concentric supramolecular bilayer (like liposomes in aqueous solution) and were capable of translocating hydrophilic drug molecules to their aqueous interior spaces. The supramolecular bilayer structure of Cy-C9/MTX provides better particle stability and drug delivery efficacy than does the supramolecular monolayer structure of Cy-C3/MTX. In addition, Cy-C9/MTX demonstrated excellent blood circulation and long-term tumor retention qualities in living mice.

To alleviate this imbalanced miRNA expression, either antagomiRs or miRNA mimics can be delivered to cells to inhibit or promote miRNA expression, respectively. Unfortunately, the clinical translation of bare antagomiRs and miRNA mimics has been challenging because nucleic acids are susceptible to nuclease degradation, display unfavorable pharmacokinetics, and cannot passively enter cells.

We evaluated SNAC in the National Cancer Database (NCDB), a source that affords multi-institutional, population studies of rare cancers and their outcomes. Methods \u2003The NCDB was queried for adenocarcinoma in the sinonasal tract. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate for factors contributing to overall survival (OS). Results \u2003A total of 553 patients were identified. The cohort was composed of 59.3% males. The nasal cavity was the most common primary site, representing 44.1% of cases. About 5.7% of patients presented with nodal disease, while 3.3% had distant metastases. About 40.6% of cases presented with stage IV disease. About 73.5% of patients underwent surgery, 54.2% received radiation therapy, and 27.7% had chemotherapy. Median OS was 71.7 months, while OS at 1, 2, and 5 years was 82, 73.0, and 52%, respectively.

As advancements in molecular testing have led to a better understanding of tumor biology, it has become increasingly evident that SNUC may actually encompass several tumor subtypes with different clinical behavior. As a result, it is also likely that all SNUC patients cannot be treated in the same fashion. Recent investigations have identified loss of the tumor suppressor SMARCB1 (INI1) expression in a subset of undifferentiated sinonasal tumors and extrasinonasal tumors and, studies have suggested that this genetic aberration may be a poor prognostic marker. The objective of this study was to identify differential expression of SMARCB1 in SNUC and to analyze and compare the survival outcomes in SNUC patients with and without SMARCB1 expression. Methods \u2003All cases of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated neoplasms of the sinonasal tract treated between 2007 and 2018 at a single tertiary care institution were selected. All cases of SNUC were tested for SMARCB1 status by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical parameters were analyzed using Student's t -test and Fischer's test. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate survival durations, while comparison between both the subgroups was done using the log-rank test. Statistical analysis was performed with the use of SPSS software, Version 25 (IBM, New York, NY, United States). Results \u2003Fourteen cases of SNUC were identified. Approximately two-thirds (64%; n \u2009=\u20099) of patients were male and the majority (79%; n \u2009=\u200911) were between fifth to seventh decade. Skull base and orbital invasion were seen in 79% ( n \u2009=\u200911) and 93% ( n \u2009=\u200913) of cases, respectively. Fifty-seven percent of tumors ( n \u2009=\u20098) retained SMARCB1 expression by IHC (SR-SNUC), while the remaining 43% ( n \u2009=\u20096) showed loss of SMARCB1 expression and, thus, were considered as SMARCB1 -deficient (SD-SNUC). Although clinicopathological features and treatment modalities were similar, SD-SNUC showed poorer (OS: p \u2009=\u20090.07; disease free survival [DFS]: p \u2009=\u20090.02) overall survival (OS) and DFS on Kaplan-Meier curves. Additionally, SD-SNUC showed higher recurrence (75 vs. 17%) and mortality (67 vs. 14%) (hazard rate\u2009=\u20098.562; p \u2009=\u20090.05) rates.

Methods: In this study, six commercially available CSTDs were tested utilizing draft NIOSH vapor containment protocol methodology to simulate drug compounding and administration using 70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as the challenge agent.

The GLT not only possessed excellent stability, but also inhibited the metastases by acting on different phases of the metastatic cascade. The hydrophobic TOS inhibited the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), the hydrophilic LMWH inhibited the interaction between tumor cells and platelets.

Benefit from its glutathione and reactive oxygen species responsiveness, the loaded paclitaxel and doxorubicin can be quickly and tracelessly released into the cytoplasm in their original form, which bestows PPPDMA nanogels the capability to overwhelm the processing capacity of cancer cell's P-glycoprotein efflux pump allows, and ultimately kill them without inducing side effects.

PET imaging has a high contrast but blurry tumor edges due to its limited spatial resolution, while CT imaging has a high resolution but a low contrast between tumor and soft normal tissues. Tumor segmentation from either a single PET or CT image is difficult. It is known that co-segmentation methods utilizing the complementary information between PET and CT can improve segmentation accuracy. These information can be either consistent or inconsistent in the image-level. How to correctly localize tumor edges with these inconsistent information is a major challenge for co-segmentation methods. In this study, we proposed a novel variational method for tumor co-segmentation in PET/CT, with a fusion strategy specifically designed to handle the information inconsistency between PET and CT in an adaptive way - the method can automatically decide which modality should be more trustful when PET and CT disagree to each other for localizing the tumor boundary. The proposed method was constructed based on the \u0393-convergence approximation of the Mumford-Shah (MS) segmentation model. A PET restoration process was integrated into the co-segmentation process, which further eliminate the uncertainty for tumor segmentation introduced by the blurring of tumor edges in PET. The performance of the proposed method was validated on a test dataset with fifty non-small cell lung cancer patients. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method had a high accuracy for PET/CT co-segmentation and PET restoration, and can accurately estimate the blur kernel of the PET scanner as well. For those complex images in which the tumors exhibit Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake inhomogeneity or even invade adjacent soft normal tissues, the proposed method can still accurately segment the tumors.

The ability to quantify these tractions is important in understanding and manipulating these processes. Three-dimensional traction force microscopy (3DTFM) provides reliable means of evaluating cellular tractions by first measuring the displacement of fluorescent beads in response to these tractions in the surrounding matrix, and then using this measurement to compute the tractions. However, most applications of 3DTFM assume that the surrounding extra-cellular matrix (ECM) is non-fibrous, despite the fact that in many natural and synthetic environments the ECM contains a significant proportion of fibrous components. Motivated by this, we develop a computational approach for determining tractions, while accounting for the fibrous nature of the ECM. In particular, we make use of a fiber-based constitutive model in which the stress contains contributions from a distribution of nonlinear elastic fibers and a hyperelastic matrix. We solve an inverse problem with the nodal values of the traction vector as unknowns, and minimize the difference between a predicted displacement field, obtained by solving the equations of equilibrium in conjunction with the fiber-based constitutive model, and the measured displacement field at the bead locations. We employ a gradient-based minimization method to solve this problem and determine the gradient efficiently by solving for the appropriate adjoint field. We apply this algorithm to problems with experimentally observed cell geometries and synthetic, albeit realistic, traction fields to gauge its sensitivity to noise, and quantify the impact of using an incorrect constitutive model: the so-called model error. We conclude that the approach is robust to noise, yielding about 10% error in tractions for 5% displacement noise. We also conclude that the impact of model error is significant, where using a nonlinear exponential hyperelastic model instead of the fiber-based model, can lead to more than 100% error in the traction field.

The standardized mean differences of the pooling effect size of sleep quality between the period before treatment and 1-8 weeks, 9-16 weeks, 17-24 weeks, and 25-56 weeks after the commencement of treatment were -0.020, -0.162, 0.075, and 0.216, respectively. Although the differences were not statistically significant, in view of the heterogeneity among the studies, we conducted further analysis using a linear mixed effect model. The overall results indicated poorer sleep quality as time passed from the start of the first treatment (p = 0.014). The results of this study revealed that patients experienced better sleep quality in the initial months after the beginning of treatment; however, their sleep quality became poorer between 4 months to approximately 1 year after the beginning of treatment, compared with the sleep quality before treatment, and continued to decline rather than improve during the follow-up period."], "query": "cancer", "mesh_terms": []}, "32773965": {"ArticleTitle": "Deep Learning for Variational Multimodality Tumor Segmentation in PET/CT.", "AbstractText": ["Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging can simultaneously acquire functional metabolic information and anatomical information of the human body. How to rationally fuse the complementary information in PET/CT for accurate tumor segmentation is challenging. In this study, a novel deep learning based variational method was proposed to automatically fuse multimodality information for tumor segmentation in PET/CT. A 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) was first designed and trained to produce a probability map from the CT image. The learnt probability map describes the probability of each CT voxel belonging to the tumor or the background, and roughly distinguishes the tumor from its surrounding soft tissues. A fuzzy variational model was then proposed to incorporate the probability map and the PET intensity image for an accurate multimodality tumor segmentation, where the probability map acted as a membership degree prior. A split Bregman algorithm was used to minimize the variational model. The proposed method was validated on a non-small cell lung cancer dataset with 84 PET/CT images. Experimental results demonstrated that: 1). Only a few training samples were needed for training the designed network to produce the probability map; 2). The proposed method can be applied to small datasets, normally seen in clinic research; 3). The proposed method successfully fused the complementary information in PET/CT, and outperformed two existing deep learning-based multimodality segmentation methods and other multimodality segmentation methods using traditional fusion strategies (without deep learning); 4).

In the kinetic state, a nonlinear creatinine trajectory is reducible into a \"true average\" value that can be found using calculus, proceeding from a differential equation based on the mass balance principle. Using the fundamental theorem of calculus, we prove definitively that the true average is the correct creatinine to divide by, even as the mathematical model accommodates clinical complexities such as volume change and other factors that affect creatinine kinetics. The true average of a creatinine versus time function between 2 measured creatinine values is found by a definite integral. To use the true average to compute kinetic GFR, 2 techniques are demonstrated, a graphical one and a numerical one. We apply this concept to a clinical case of an individual with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis; despite the effects of hemodialysis on serum creatinine concentration, kinetic GFR was able to track the underlying kidney function and provided critical information regarding kidney function recovery. Finally, a prior concept of the maximum increase in creatinine per day is made more clinically objective.

In this work, we produced polycaprolactone (PCL) in the sizes 1.8, 5.4, and 13.6\u00a0kDa and were able to produce spherical shaped nanoparticles with mean diameters of 64 \u00b1 19\u00a0nm out of the PCL5.4 and 45 \u00b1 8\u00a0nm out of the PCL13.6 reproducibly. By encapsulation of paclitaxel the diameter of that nanoparticles did not increase, and we were able to encapsulate 73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0fmol paclitaxel per 1000\u00a0particles in the PCL5.4-nanoparticles and 35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0fmol PTX per 1000 PCL13.6-nanoparticles.

In 2017 Hospice UK (e-hospice 3rd July Hospice UK analysis \u2018One in four UK families who need end of life care miss out on crucial support\u2019)350 estimated that one in four people, approximately 118,000, who require end of life care and their families are not able to access the expert care they need at the end of life, including hospice care or other support that they need. This is particularly true for people with conditions other than cancer and their analysis also showed that people from economically and socially deprived areas, BAME communities and LGBT people can experience barriers to accessing end of life care services. Barriers that prevent people in their last year of life accessing End of Life care can vary but poor communication and coordination of services is an ever-present theme. One of the biggest barriers is for professionals to recognise when someone has entered the last year of life and having the skills to discuss this with openness and sensitivity. This can be compounded by institutional culture, limited resource, restrictive internal policies and lack of training and education all contributing to people experiencing barriers to care during this period. Macmillan Cancer Support (Time to Choose \u2013 making choices at end of life 2013)483 also found similar barriers. Lack of information about the out-of-hours services, a reticence of some health care professionals to have \u2018difficult conversations\u2019 with patients and carers and poor inter-professional communication can all have an impact on care. It is said that nearly three quarters of people with cancer would prefer to die at home and yet less than a third are able to do so. (Macmillan \u2013 A Time to Choose, 2013).483. While it is true that some will change their mind as their symptoms change, none-the-less there is a large gap between what people want and what they experience. In addition to the general barriers, there are other others specific to different communities and groups, for instance a 2014 Marie Curie and Alzheimer\u2019s Society17 report highlights that \u2018dementia is often not recognised as a terminal diagnosis, which can lead to poor access to care, inconsistent quality of care d\u2019..

The consequences of a person dying in a setting which is inappropriate or not their preferred place of care can have considerable impact upon them and their carers, family and friends. The carers, family and friends\u2019 distress at the death may be exacerbated by the knowledge that it did not happen as the person who died wished.SMOOTH TRANSITIONS: Transition is a purposeful, planned process that addresses the medical, social and psychological needs of a person as they move from one system/place to another. Throughout this guideline many transition points have been identified, for example from one service provider to another, from one setting to another from one age group to another and from one life style to another. There appear to be no studies which are universally applicable to all transitions. Studies have included transitions between teams for example within a hospital or from hospital to home. Usually systems have been developed locally to meet identified problems with transitions, for example the use of a form or computer template, patient held records similar to those used in ante natal care. Probably the group where transition has been studied most is the transfer from children\u2019s to young persons or adult services and most of this work has been undertaken in cancer service and for those with learning difficulties. Another area where work has been undertaken is in the discharge of people from hospital to home and the copying letters to patients is an initiative, which has its roots in this area. There appear to be some principles, which can help to make these transitions smoother. These include effective methods of communication, verbal, written, and electronic, between all those involved. It is most effective if the person who is being transferred and their relatives, carers and those important to them are all included. However there does not appear to be one factor that overwhelmingly contributes to a smooth discharge but a number of things which taken in combination makes transitions smoother. RAPID DISCHARGE: For patients who require rapid discharge to their preferred place of death (usually their home from hospital) there is a need for a clear process that allows for the timely initiation of resources with which to facilitate this care planning. This may or may not necessitate rapid access to specialist palliative care. It is dependent on the patient\u2019s wishes being known to health care professional and relatives usually in the form of and Advanced Care Plan (ACP) and Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders and the ability of local system processes to enable the prompt implementation of support services once the patient has arrived at their preferred place of death. As with all rapid discharges what underpins them is effective communication with all parties and clear, concise documentation that allows for a smooth transition of care. With an ever-increasing pressure on services provided by health care providers, there is a widespread recognition that effective discharge planning from the time of admission is essential to enable a patient centred pathway, which is both safe and effective. The rapid discharge of patients is multi-factorial being dependent on realistic estimated day of discharge, senior decision making, effective communication, liaison with other health care partners, the families and most importantly the patient themselves. Much has been written in the literature regarding discharge, which has accumulated in national programmes such as the \u2018SAFER\u2019 bundle and most recently the \u2018End PJ paralysis\u2019 campaign both of which have seen improvements in improving the discharge process for patients."], "query": "cancer", "mesh_terms": []}, "32601549": {"ArticleTitle": "A Translational Pipeline for Overall Survival Prediction of Breast Cancer Patients by Decision-Level Integration of Multi-Omics Data.", "AbstractText": ["Breast cancer is the most prevalent and among the most deadly cancers in females.

Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our multiscale networks utilizing the WSI image pyramids can achieve higher accuracy for the classification of breast cancer.

Inhibition of U1 base-pairing with U1 snRNA antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (U1 AMO) mimics widespread PCPA from cryptic polyadenylation signals (PASs) in human tissues, including PCPA in introns and last exons' 3'-untranslated regions (3' UTRs). U1 telescripting-PCPA balance changes generate diverse RNAs depending on where in a gene it occurs. Long genes are highly U1-telescripting-dependent because of PASs in introns compared to short genes. Enrichment of cell cycle control, differentiation, and developmental functions in long genes, compared to housekeeping and acute cell stress response genes in short genes, reveals a gene size-function relationship in mammalian genomes. This polarization increased in metazoan evolution by previously unexplained intron expansion, suggesting that U1 telescripting could shift global gene expression priorities. We show that that modulating U1 availability can profoundly alter cell phenotype, such as cancer cell migration and invasion, underscoring the critical role of U1 homeostasis and suggesting it as a potential target for therapies.

There is evidence suggesting that counseling in stress management-oriented therapeutic interventions (as offered by lifestyle medicine-oriented practitioners) may prevent or reduce the onset, severity, duration, and/or overall burden of stress-related illnesses. Such counseling often involves considerations such as the patient's nutrition, physical activity, interest in/capacity to meditate, drug abuse/cessation, and so on.

There is no solid evidence of negative clinical effect from the retention of macrocyclic agents in the brain while there is evidence that they wash out of the brain over time.

We categorize these methods based on the type of input data that they use (space-resolved or time-resolved), and also based on their computational formulation as either combinatorial or probabilistic. It is crucial to understand the different types of input data because each provides essential but distinct information for drastically reducing the solution space of the clonal reconstruction problem.

In this paper we are interested in situations where data show departures from Gaussianity, therefore requiring alternative modeling distributions. The multivariate t-distribution, obtained by dividing each component of the data vector by a gamma random variable, is a straightforward generalization to accommodate deviations from normality such as heavy tails. Since different groups of variables may be contaminated to a different extent, Finegold and Drton (2014) introduced the Dirichlet t-distribution, where the divisors are clustered using a Dirichlet process. In this work, we consider a more general class of nonparametric distributions as the prior on the divisor terms, namely the class of normalized completely random measures (NormCRMs). To improve the effectiveness of the clustering, we propose modeling the dependence among the divisors through a nonparametric hierarchical structure, which allows for the sharing of parameters across the samples in the data set.
