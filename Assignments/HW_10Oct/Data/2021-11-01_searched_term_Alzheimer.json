They are made up of protofilaments composed of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides that are held together with extraordinary stability by a network of tight steric zippers and axial hydrogen bonds. This review explores the hypothesis that the peptide conformation within a protofilament represents the physical embodiment of a \"strain\" of AD. Evidence suggests that within a single strain the fold of individual peptides is invariant. However, the fibrils are capable of structural polymorphism that includes variation in the arrangement of protofilaments into fibrils, the pitch of the resultant fibrils, and the higher-order organization of the plaques into which they aggregate. These intrastrain polymorphisms are separated by low energy barriers, allowing multiple configurations to coexist within a single preparation or tissue. Clinical presentation of different strains may be determined by variation in the way different protofilament structures generate the relevant toxic species, be they monomers, oligomers, or higher-order structures. Evidence reviewed here is consistent with a model in which disease progression is concomitant with a gradual, progressive annealing of amyloid fibrils from benign, loosely packed structures into dense neurotoxic aggregates. This model challenges the commonly held hypothesis that oligomers of A\u03b2 peptides are the only active proximate species in neurodegeneration. However, the data do not implicate fibrils themselves. Rather, they cast suspicion on larger-scale supramolecular aggregates as toxic agents. Electron tomography of amyloid plaques in situ strongly suggests that the formation of amyloid aggregates results in perturbation of the cellular membrane integrity, warranting further investigation of this as a potential mode of neurotoxicity.

Tau aggregation in the different Tauopathies differs in the affected cell type, the structure of aggregates and Tau isoform composition. However, in all Tauopathies, accumulation of pathological Tau in well-characterized and well-defined brain regions, correlates strongly with symptoms associated with the dysfunction of this brain region. Hence, symptoms of neurodegenerative Tauopathies can range from motoric to cognitive and behavioral symptoms, even extending to deterioration of vital functions when the disease progresses, or combinations of different symptoms governed by the affected brain regions. The most common Tauopathies are corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and frontotemporal dementias with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). However a growing number of diseases are characterized by Tau aggregation amounting to a large family of more than 20 disorders [176]. Most Tauopathies are sporadic, and are hence linked to a combination of environmental and genetic risk factors. However, mutations in MAPT have been identified which are autosomal dominantly linked to Tauopathies, including FTDP, PSP and CBD [94, 163, 185] (Alzforum, https://www.alzforum.org/mutations/mapt ). More than 80 mutations have been identified in MAPT, both in intronic and exonic regions of the human MAPT. These mutations can be classified as missense mutations or splicing mutations. Most missense mutations cluster in or near the microtubule binding site of Tau, while most splicing mutations affect the splicing of exon 10 (encoding the R2 domain), and hence affect the 3R/4R ratio. While Alzheimer's disease (AD), is the most prevalent Tauopathy, no mutations in MAPT associated with AD have been identified. Brains of AD patients are pathologically characterized by the combined presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [171]. Familial forms of AD, termed early onset familial AD (EOFAD) with clinical mutations in APP or PS1/2, have an early onset, and are invariably characterized by the combined presence of amyloid and Tau pathology [24, 80, 170]. These EOFAD cases, identify a causal link between APP/PS1 misprocessing and the development of Tau pathology and neurodegeneration [80, 170]. Furthermore, combined genetic, pathological, biomarker and in vivo modelling data, indicate that amyloid pathology precedes Tau pathology, and support a role for A\u03b2 as initiator and Tau as executor in the pathogenetic process of AD [80, 96, 97]. Hence, AD is often considered as a secondary Tauopathy (similar as for Down syndrome patients), in contrast to the primary Tauopathies described above. Tau aggregates in Tauopathies vary with respect to the ratio of different Tau isoforms (3R/4R), to the cell types displaying Tau aggregation and the structure of the aggregates.

Fast axonal transport is a critical process for maintaining axons and functioning synapses, critical subcellular compartments underlying neuronal connectivity. Signs of fast axonal transport disruption are pervasive in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies and various mechanisms have been proposed for regulation of fast axonal transport by tau. Post-translational modifications of tau including phosphorylation at specific sites, FTDP-17 point mutations, and oligomerization, confer upon tau a toxic effect on fast axonal transport.

These antibodies were incubated with a brain tissue extract, prepared from frontal cortex, pons, cerebellum and brain stem. Protein antigens captured by the protein-G magnetic bead-bound antibodies were digested with trypsin and analyzed using mass spectrometry.

Methods: Participants had probable AD with no other major conditions affecting locomotion. The intervention consisted of eight progressively modified 45-min gait training sessions delivered during home visits over 4 weeks. Experienced physiotherapists provided the therapy that incorporated rhythmic music cues for a range of locomotor tasks and ambulatory activities. On the days when the physiotherapist did not attend, participants independently performed a seated music listening activity.

Models of the extracellular domain of TREM2 show that Nasu-Hakola disease-associated mutations are grossly inactivating by truncation, frameshift, or unfolding, that Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated variants localize to a putative ligand-interacting region (PLIR) on the extracellular surface, and that FTD-associated variants are found in the hydrophobic core.

Our model, which is based on a published 2.2 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of the TREM2 extracellular domain, finds that both AD- and FTD-associated variants cause localized instability in three loops adjacent to the PLIR that correspond to the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies. This instability ultimately disrupts tethering between these CDRs and the core of the immunoglobulin domain, exposing a group of otherwise-buried, negatively charged residues. This instability and exposure of negatively charged residues is most severe following introduction of the T66M variant that has been described as causing FTD even in the heterozygous state and is less severe following introduction of variants that are less strongly tied to FTD or of those associated with AD.

We used whole-cell recordings in brainstem slices from juvenile mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the glycine transporter type 2 (GlyT2) promoter, to examine muscarinic modulation of morphologically identified glycinergic neurons in the preB\u00f6tzinger complex (preB\u00f6tC), an area critical for central inspiratory rhythm generation. Biocytin-filled reconstruction of glycinergic neurons revealed that the majority of them had few primary dendrites and had axons arborized within their own dendritic field. Few glycinergic neurons had axon collaterals extended towards the premotor/motor areas or ran towards the contralateral preB\u00f6tC, and had more primary dendrites and more compact dendritic trees. Spontaneously active glycinergic neurons fired regular spikes, or less frequently in a \"burst-like\" pattern at physiological potassium concentration. Muscarine suppressed firing in the majority of regular spiking neurons via M2 receptor activation while enhancing the remaining neurons through M1 receptors. Interestingly, rhythmic bursting was augmented by muscarine in a small group of glycinergic neurons. In contrast to its heterogeneous modulation of glycinergic neuronal excitability, muscarine generally depressed inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs onto both glycinergic and non-glycinergic preB\u00f6tC neurons, with a stronger effect on inhibitory input. Notably, presynaptic muscarinic attenuation of excitatory synaptic input was dependent on M1 receptors in glycinergic neurons and on M2 receptors in non-glycinergic neurons. Additional field potential recordings of excitatory synaptic potentials in the M2 receptor knockout mice indicate that glycinergic and non-glycinergic neurons contribute equally to the general suppression by muscarine of excitatory activity in preB\u00f6tC circuits. In conclusion, our data show that preB\u00f6tC glycinergic neurons are morphologically heterogeneous, and differ in the properties of synaptic transmission and muscarinic modulation in comparison to non-glycinergic neurons.

Withdrawal of Ubisol-Q10 treatment also leads to the return of the senescence phenotype in AD fibroblasts indicating that constant supplementation of Ubisol-Q10 is required. Additionally, Ubisol-Q10 supplementation in the drinking water of double transgenic AD mice leads to increased expression of beclin-1 and JNK1 in the cortical region.

Ferritin is a 24 subunit spherical shell protein composed of both light (FTL) and heavy chain (FTH1) subunits, possessing complimentary iron-handling functions and forming three-fold and four-fold pores. Iron uptake through the three-fold pores is well-defined, but the unloading process somewhat less and generally focuses on lysosomal ferritin degradation although it may have an additional, energetically efficient pore mechanism. Hereditary Ferritinopathy (HF) or neuroferritinopathy is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the FTL C-terminal sequence, which in turn cause disorder and unraveling at the four-fold pores allowing iron leakage and enhanced formation of toxic, improperly coordinated iron (ICI). Histopathologically, HF is characterized by iron deposition and formation of ferritin inclusion bodies (IBs) as the cells overexpress ferritin in an attempt to address iron accumulation while lacking the ability to clear ferritin and its aggregates. Overexpression and IB formation tax cells materially and energetically, i.e., their synthesis and disposal systems, and may hinder cellular transport and other spatially dependent functions. ICI causes cellular damage to proteins and lipids through reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation because of high levels of brain oxygen, reductants and metabolism, taxing cellular repair. Iron can cause protein aggregation both indirectly by ROS-induced protein modification and destabilization, and directly as with mutant ferritin through C-terminal bridging. Iron release and ferritin degradation are also linked to cellular misfunction through ferritinophagy, which can release sufficient iron to initiate the unique programmed cell death process ferroptosis causing ROS formation and lipid peroxidation. But IB buildup suggests suppressed ferritinophagy, with elevated iron from four-fold pore leakage together with ROS damage and stress leading to a long-term ferroptotic-like state in HF.

Cognitive impairment and dementia have traditionally been stratified into subtypes of varying origin, e.g., vascular dementia versus dementia of the Alzheimer's type (Alzheimer's disease; AD). Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow in the brain, often as a result of SVD, and AD is thought to have its genesis in the accumulation of tau and amyloid-beta leading to brain atrophy.

Cannabis plant has many species, but there are three main species including Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis. Over 70 compounds isolated from cannabis species are called cannabinoids (CBN). Cannabinoids produce over 100 naturally occurring chemicals. The most abundant chemicals are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD). THC is psychotropic chemical that makes people feel \"high\" while CBD is nonpsychotropic chemical. However, cannabinoid chemicals are not found only in the cannabis plant, they are also produced by the mammalian body, called endocannabinoids and in the laboratory, called synthesized cannabinoids. Endocannabinoids are endogenous lipid-based retrograde neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors, and cannabinoid receptor proteins that are expressed throughout the mammalian central nervous system including brain and peripheral nervous system. There are at least two types of endocannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) which are G-protein coupled receptors. CB1 receptors are particularly abundant in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, hypothalamus and cerebellum, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. They are present in inhibitory GABA-ergic neurons and excitatory glutamatergic neurons. CB2 receptor is most abundantly found on cells of the immune system, hematopoietic cells and glia cells. CB2 is mainly expressed in the periphery under normal healthy condition, but in conditions of disease or injury, this upregulation occurs within the brain, and CB2 is therefore expressed in the brain in unhealthy states. Cannabis and cannabinoid are studied in different medical conditions. The therapeutic potentials of both cannabis and cannabinoid are related to the effects of THC, CBD and other cannabinoid compounds. However, the \"high\" effect of THC in cannabis and cannabinoid may limit the clinical use, particularly, the study on the therapeutic potential of THC alone is more limited. This review emphasizes the therapeutic potential of CBD and CBD with THC. CBD has shown to have benefit in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, psychosis, neuropathic pain, cancer pain, HIV, migraine, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, hypoxic-ischemic injury and epilepsy.

Genetic variants in presenilin (PSEN) 1 and 2 genes lead to autosomal dominant early-onset AD (ADAD); patients with PSEN gene variants also report seizures. Pharmacological control of seizures in AD may be disease-modifying. Preclinical efficacy of FDA-approved antiseizure drugs (ASDs) is well defined in young adult rodents; however, the efficacy of ASDs in aged rodents with chronic seizures is less clear. The mechanism by which ADAD genes lead to AD remains unclear, and even less studied is the pathogenesis of epilepsy in AD. PSEN variants generally all result in a biochemical loss of function (De Strooper, 2007). We herein determined whether well-established models of acute and chronic seizure could be used to explore the relationship between AD genes and seizures through investigating whether loss of normal PSEN2 function age-dependently influenced susceptibility to seizures and/or corneal kindling acquisition. PSEN2 knockout (KO) and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice were screened from 2- to 10-months-old to establish age-dependent focal seizure threshold. Additionally, PSEN2 KO and WT mice aged 2- and 8-months-old underwent corneal kindling such that mice were aged 3- and 9-months old at the beginning of ASD efficacy testing. We then defined the dose-dependent efficacy of mechanistically distinct ASDs on kindled seizures of young versus aged mice to better understand the applicability of corneal kindling to real-world use for geriatric patients. PSEN2 KO mice demonstrated early-life reductions in seizure threshold. However, kindling acquisition was delayed in 2-month-old PSEN2 KO versus WT mice. Young male WT mice took 24.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 (S.E.M.) stimulations to achieve kindling criterion, whereas age-matched PSEN2 KO male mice took 41.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 stimulations (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). The rate of kindling acquisition of 8-month-old mice was no longer different from WT. This study demonstrates that loss of normal PSEN2 function is associated with age-dependent changes in the in vivo susceptibility to acute seizures and kindling. Loss of normal PSEN2 function may be an underexplored molecular contributor to seizures.

Although, research on AD has increased in recent years, however, the complexity associated with brain structure and functions makes the early diagnosis of this disease a challenging task. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a neuroimaging technology that has been widely used to study the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In literature, the computer-aided diagnosis of AD is limited to binary classification or diagnosis of AD and MCI stages. However, its applicability to diagnose multiple progressive stages of AD is relatively under-studied. This study explores the effectiveness of rs-fMRI for multi-class classification of AD and its associated stages including CN, SMC, EMCI, MCI, LMCI, and AD. A longitudinal cohort of resting-state fMRI of 138 subjects (25 CN, 25 SMC, 25 EMCI, 25 LMCI, 13 MCI, and 25\u00a0AD) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is studied. To provide a better insight into deep learning approaches and their applications to AD classification, we investigate ResNet-18 architecture in detail. We consider the training of the network from scratch by using single-channel input as well as performed transfer learning with and without fine-tuning using an extended network architecture. We experimented with residual neural networks to perform AD classification task and compared it with former research in this domain. The performance of the models is evaluated using precision, recall, f1-measure, AUC and ROC curves. We found that our networks were able to significantly classify the subjects. We achieved improved results with our fine-tuned model for all the AD stages with an accuracy of 100%, 96.85%, 97.38%, 97.43%, 97.40% and 98.01% for CN, SMC, EMCI, LMCI, MCI, and AD respectively. However, in terms of overall performance, we achieved state-of-the-art results with an average accuracy of 97.92% and 97.88% for off-the-shelf and fine-tuned models respectively.

MAPK-activated protein kinase II (MK2), downstream kinase of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 MAPK, was unveiled as a promising option for the treatment of AD. Increasing evidence points at MK2 as involved in neuroinflammatory responses. MMI-0100, a cell-penetrating peptide inhibitor of MK2, exhibits anti-inflammatory effects and is in current clinical trials for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, it is important to understand the actions of MMI-0100 in neuroinflammation. Methods: The mouse memory function was evaluated using novel object recognition (NOR) and object location recognition (OLR) tasks. Brain hippocampus tissue samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and immunostaining. Near-infrared fluorescent and confocal microscopy experiments were used to detect the brain uptake and distribution after intranasal MMI-0100 application. Results: Central MMI-0100 was able to ameliorate the memory deficit induced by A\u03b21-42 or LPS in novel object and location memory tasks. MMI-0100 suppressed LPS-induced activation of astrocytes and microglia, and dramatically decreased a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, and iNOS via inhibiting phosphorylation of MK2, but not ERK, JNK, and p38 in vivo and in vitro.

Therefore, in all likelihood A\u03b2 attracts peripheral blood neutrophils, monocytes, as well as microglia cells in brain parenchyma, and activates them. However, the role of microglia cells and their precursor monocytes in AD pathogenesis remains elusive. Recently, neutrophils were found to be present in areas with A\u03b2 deposits in AD brain and in transgenic AD model mice. Because brain is vulnerable to the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophils secrete a large amount of ROS, neutrophils look like a driving force of AD. Therefore, a possibility arises that anti-IL-17A and anti-IL-23 antibodies are effective against AD, because these antibodies can be thought to interfere with neutrophil trafficking from the bone marrow to the blood circulation and thus inhibit neutrophil infiltration into AD brain.

In Case 2, a 70-year-old man with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease and hypertension presented with acute loss of consciousness and left hemiparesis, without evidence of hypoglycemia or a hypertensive crisis. In both cases, ASL-MRI perfusion images showed focal cerebral hyperperfusion in the posterior cingulate and parietal associative cortex, which involved neurodegenerative areas associated with epilepsy in early Alzheimer's disease. In both cases, the patients developed generalized tonic-clonic epileptic seizures that lasted for 5 minutes or more, which indicated the emergence of status epilepticus that developed from the initial presentation of NCSE. In both cases, electroencephalogram (EEG) findings confirmed that the seizures were controlled by intravenous administration of antiepileptic drugs.

To address this public health problem, the research community has developed computational approaches to sift through various aspects of clinical data and uncover their insights, among which one of the most challenging problem is to determine the biological mechanisms that cause AD to develop. To study this problem, in this paper we present a novel Joint Multi-Modal Longitudinal Regression and Classification method and show how it can be used to identify the cognitive status of the participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and the underlying biological mechanisms.

Because the proposed objective is a non-smooth optimization problem that is difficult to solve in general, we derive an efficient iterative algorithm and rigorously prove its convergence. To validate our new method in predicting the cognitive scores of patients and their clinical diagnosis, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the ADNI cohort.

Different from existing methods that separately deal with each single view, this paper proposes a discriminative Margin-Sensitive Autoencoder (MSAE) framework for automated Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and accurate protein fold recognition. Generally, our MSAE aims to collaboratively explore the complementary properties of multi-view bioimage features in a semantic-sensitive encoder-decoder paradigm, where the discriminative semantic space is explicitly constructed in a margin-scalable regression model. Specifically, we develop a semantic-sensitive autoencoder, where an encoder projects multi-view visual features into the common semantic-aware latent space, and a decoder is exerted as an additional constraint to reconstruct the respective visual features. In particular, the importance of different views is adaptively weighted by self-adjusting learning scheme, such that their underlying correlations and complementary characteristics across multiple views are simultaneously preserved into the latent common representations. Moreover, a flexible semantic space is formulated by a margin-scalable support vector machine to improve the discriminability of the learning model. Importantly, correntropy induced metric is exploited as a robust regularization measurement to better control outliers for effective classification. A half-quadratic minimization and alternating learning strategy are devised to optimize the resulting framework such that each subproblem exists a closed-form solution in each iterative minimization phase. Extensive experimental results performed on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets show that our MSAE can achieve superior performances for both binary and multi-class classification in AD diagnosis, and evaluations on protein folds demonstrate that our method can achieve very encouraging performance on protein structure recognition, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods."], "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh_terms": ["Alzheimer Diseasediagnostic imaging", "Databases, Factual", "Discrimination Learningphysiology", "Humans", "Neuroimagingmethods", "Pattern Recognition, Automatedmethods", "Support Vector Machine"]}, "31837501": {"ArticleTitle": "Design, synthesis and evaluation of diosgenin carbamate derivatives as multitarget anti-Alzheimer's disease agents.", "AbstractText": ["In order to produce an effective and multi-targeted clinical drug that could prevent progressive neurodegeneration, a series of diosgenin carbamate derivatives were designed, synthesized and tested for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-A\u03b2 activities.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical precursor of AD. Although some treatments can delay its progression, no effective cures are available for AD. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of AD is vital for the prevention and intervention of the disease progression. Hippocampus is one of the first affected brain regions in AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these features encode limited information and may suffer from segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is independent of the classification model, which could result in sub-optimal performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep learning framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint automatic hippocampal segmentation and AD classification using structural MRI data. Firstly, a multi-task deep CNN model is constructed for jointly learning hippocampal segmentation and disease classification. Then, we construct a 3D Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (3D DenseNet) to learn features of the 3D patches extracted based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the classification task. Finally, the learned features from the multi-task CNN and DenseNet models are combined to classify disease status.

The most probable explanations for failures of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for AD may include late initiation of treatments during the course of AD development, inappropriate drug dosages, erroneous selection of treatment targets, and mainly an inadequate understanding of the complex pathophysiology of AD, which may necessitate combination treatments rather than monotherapy. Clinical trials' methodological issues have also been criticized. Drug-development research for AD is aimed to overcome these drawbacks. Preclinical and prodromal AD populations, as well as traditionally investigated populations representing all the clinical stages of AD, are included in recent trials. Systematic use of biomarkers in staging preclinical and prodromal AD and of a single primary outcome in trials of prodromal AD are regularly integrated. The application of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration biomarkers, including new biomarkers-such as Tau positron emission tomography, neurofilament light chain (blood and Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker of axonal degeneration) and neurogranin (CSF biomarker of synaptic functioning)-to clinical trials allows more precise staging of AD. Additionally, use of Bayesian statistics, modifiable clinical trial designs, and clinical trial simulators enrich the trial methodology.

Understanding reference requires the listener to keep track of the unfolding discourse history while integrating multiple sources of information to interpret the speech stream as it unfolds in time. Pronouns are a common way to establish reference. But due to their impoverished form, to understand them listeners must relate features of the pronoun (e.g., gender, animacy) with existing representations of potential discourse referents. Successful referential processing seems to place demands on memory. In a previous study, patients with hippocampal amnesia and healthy participants listened to short stories as their eye movements were monitored. When interpreting ambiguous pronouns, healthy participants demonstrated order-of-mention effects, whereby ambiguous pronouns are interpreted as referring to the first-mentioned referent in the story. By contrast, memory-impaired patients exhibited significant disruptions in their ability to use information about which character had been mentioned first to interpret pronouns. Repetition of the most salient information is a common clinical recommendation for improving pronoun resolution and communication in individuals with memory disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) but this recommendation lacks an evidentiary basis.

Fortunately, cells have evolved several antioxidant defense mechanisms (as metabolites, vitamins, and enzymes) to neutralize or mitigate the harmful effect of reactive species and/or their byproducts. Any perturbation in the balance in the level of antioxidants and the reactive species results in a physiological condition called \"oxidative stress.\" A catalase is one of the crucial antioxidant enzymes that mitigates oxidative stress to a considerable extent by destroying cellular hydrogen peroxide to produce water and oxygen. Deficiency or malfunction of catalase is postulated to be related to the pathogenesis of many age-associated degenerative diseases like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, anemia, vitiligo, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, cancer, and schizophrenia. Therefore, efforts are being undertaken in many laboratories to explore its use as a potential drug for the treatment of such diseases.

Previously, we showed that nucleolar PARP-1 is significantly decreased in hippocampal pyramidal cells in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We proposed that the displacement of PARP-1 from the nucleolus results in downregulation of new rRNA expression and ribosome biogenesis, leading to cognitive impairment. To further investigate the relationship between nucleolar PARP-1 and memory impairment, we examined PARP-1 expression in the hippocampi of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to control and AD cases. We used immunohistochemical techniques to examine the nucleolar distribution of PARP-1 in the Cornu Ammonis (CA region) of the hippocampus. PARP-1 positive cells were then scored for the presence or absence of PARP-1 in the nucleolus. We found a significant decrease of PARP-1 staining in the nucleolar compartment of hippocampal pyramidal cells in MCI compared with Control and AD. When the four CA (CA1-4) regions were considered separately, only the CA1 region showed significant differences in nucleolar PARP-1 with Control > AD > MCI cases. Categorization of nucleolar PARP-1 into \"distinct\" and \"diffuse\" groups suggest that most of the changes occur within the distinct group.

Besides, few of these existing approaches consider the explicit detection and modeling of discriminative brain regions (i.e., network hubs) that are sensitive to AD progression. In this paper, we propose a unique Spatial-Temporal convolutional-recurrent neural Network (STNet) for automated prediction of AD progression and network hub detection from rs-fMRI time series. Our STNet incorporates the spatial-temporal information mining and AD-related hub detection into an end-to-end deep learning model. Specifically, we first partition rs-fMRI time series into a sequence of overlapping sliding windows. A sequence of convolutional components are then designed to capture the local-to-global spatially-dependent patterns within each sliding window, based on which we are able to identify discriminative hubs and characterize their unique contributions to disease diagnosis. A recurrent component with long short-term memory (LSTM) units is further employed to model the whole-brain temporal dependency from the spatially-dependent pattern sequences, thus capturing the temporal dynamics along time.

Excessive compounds, associated with injury signalling and repair, start to accumulate, adding to axonal injury.

This enhanced neurogenesis correlates well with elevated expression of TGF-\u03b22 and TGF-\u03b23, and activation of their downstream signaling molecule Smad2. Intriguingly, the enhanced adult neurogenesis was mitigated when Smad2 expression was deleted in neurons, supporting a role for the CX3CL1-TGF-\u03b22/3-Smad2 pathway in the control of adult neurogenesis. When Tg-CX3CL1 mice were crossed with Alzheimer's PS19 mice, which overexpress a tau P301S mutation and exhibit age-dependent neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration, overexpressed CX3CL1 in both male and female mice was sufficient to rescue the neurodegeneration, increase survival time, and improve cognitive function.

In this study, we examined the function of mitochondrial protein deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) in the pathogenesis of AD. Compared with AppPs1 mice, Sirt3-haploinsufficient AppPs1 mice (Sirt3+/-AppPs1) exhibit early epileptiform EEG activity and seizure. Both male and female Sirt3+/-AppPs1 mice were observed to die prematurely before 5 months of age. When comparing male mice among different genotypes, Sirt3 haploinsufficiency renders GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex vulnerable to degeneration and associated neuronal network hyperexcitability. Feeding Sirt3+/-AppPs1 AD mice with a ketone ester-rich diet increases SIRT3 expression and prevents seizure-related death and the degeneration of GABAergic neurons, indicating that the aggravated GABAergic neuron loss and neuronal network hyperexcitability in Sirt3+/-AppPs1 mice are caused by SIRT3 reduction and can be rescued by increase of SIRT3 expression. Consistent with a protective role in AD, SIRT3 levels are reduced in association with cerebral cortical A\u03b2 pathology in AD patients. In summary, SIRT3 preserves GABAergic interneurons and protects cerebral circuits against hyperexcitability, and this neuroprotective mechanism can be bolstered by dietary ketone esters.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT GABAergic neurons provide the main inhibitory control of neuronal activity in the brain.

Similarities existing between synaptic plasticity and principles governing brain network organization could be helpful to define brain network properties and reorganization profiles after damage. In this review, we discuss how different forms of synaptic plasticity, including homeostatic and anti-homeostatic mechanisms, could be directly involved in generating specific brain network characteristics. We propose that long-term potentiation could represent the neurophysiological basis for the formation of highly connected nodes (hubs).

Recent studies have indicated that the prion protein (PrP) is one of the cell-surface receptors, so-called a bad receptor, of A\u03b2 oligomers that mediates downstream cellular toxicity. A rational classification of A\u03b2 oligomers on the basis of conformation indicates that there are two distinct types of oligomers, namely, prefibrillar and fibrillar oligomers that are positive to A11 and OC conformation-dependent antibodies, respectively. The mechanism of heterotypic assembly of conformationally distinct oligomers and PrP is poorly understood. In this work, using an array of biophysical and biochemical tools, we dissect the molecular mechanism of the interaction of A11- and OC-positive A\u03b242 oligomers with human PrP. Using site-specific binding titrations, we show that the recruitment of A\u03b2 oligomers primarily occurs via the electrostatic interaction between the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of PrP and A\u03b2 oligomers. Our results demonstrate that OC-positive fibrillar oligomers possessing in-register parallel \u03b2-sheet packing displayed \u223c30 times stronger binding with PrP compared to A11-positive oligomers. We also show that these OC-positive oligomers exacerbate their toxic effects on mammalian cells upon binding to PrP. On the contrary, the addition of PrP does not alter the toxicity exhibited by A11-positive oligomers.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether PET with the weak ABCB1 substrate radiotracer 11C-metoclopramide can measure ABCB1 induction at the BBB in a \u03b2-amyloidosis mouse model (APP/PS1-21 mice) and in wild-type mice. Methods: Groups of wild-type and APP/PS1-21 mice aged 50 or 170 d underwent 11C-metoclopramide baseline PET scans or scans after intraperitoneal treatment with the rodent pregnane X receptor activator 5-pregnen-3\u03b2-ol-20-one-16\u03b1-carbonitrile (PCN, 25 mg/kg) or its vehicle over 7 d.

In separate groups of mice, radiolabeled metabolites of 11C-metoclopramide were determined in plasma and brain at 15 min after radiotracer injection. As an outcome parameter of cerebral ABCB1 activity, the elimination slope of radioactivity washout from the brain (k E,brain) was calculated. Results: PCN treatment resulted in an increased clearance of radioactivity from the brain as reflected by significant increases in k E,brain (from +26% to +54% relative to baseline). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed ABCB1 induction in the brains of PCN-treated APP/PS1-21 mice with a concomitant decrease in A\u03b2 levels. There was a significant positive correlation between k E,brain and ABCB1 levels in the brain. In wild-type mice, a significant age-related decrease in k E,brain was found.

The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key axonal transport cargo since disruption to APP transport promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Moreover, altered APP processing itself disrupts axonal transport. The mechanisms that regulate axonal transport of APP are therefore directly relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. APP is transported anterogradely through axons on kinesin-1 motors and one route for this transport involves calsyntenin-1, a type-1 membrane spanning protein that acts as a direct ligand for kinesin-1 light chains (KLCs). Thus, loss of calsyntenin-1 disrupts APP axonal transport and promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Phosphorylation of KLC1 on serine-460 has been shown to reduce anterograde axonal transport of calsyntenin-1 by inhibiting the KLC1-calsyntenin-1 interaction.

The recent failure of clinical trials based on the immunotherapeutic approach against amyloid-\u03b2(A\u03b2) protein questioned the validity of the \"amyloid cascade hypothesis\" as the molecular machinery causing the disease. Indeed, most attempts to design effective treatments for AD have been based until now on molecular targets suggested to be implicated in AD pathogenesis by the amyloid cascade hypothesis. However, mounting evidence from scientific literature supports the view of AD as a multifactorial disease that results from the concomitant action of multiple molecular players. This view, together with the lack of success of the disease-modifying single-target approaches, strongly suggests that AD drug design needs to be shifted towards multi-targeted compounds or drug combinations acting synergistically on the main core features of disease pathogenesis. The discovery of drug candidates targeting multiple factors involved in AD would greatly improve drug development.

Oxidative stress affects expression levels of multiple microRNAs and, conversely, microRNAs regulate many genes involved in an oxidative stress response.

We carried out longitudinal within-subject studies in male and female psychiatric patients to discover blood gene expression biomarkers that track short term memory as measured by the retention measure in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. These biomarkers were subsequently prioritized with a convergent functional genomics approach using previous evidence in the field implicating them in AD. The top candidate biomarkers were then tested in an independent cohort for ability to predict state short-term memory, and trait future positive neuropsychological testing for cognitive impairment. The best overall evidence was for a series of new, as well as some previously known genes, which are now newly shown to have functional evidence in humans as blood biomarkers: RAB7A, NPC2, TGFB1, GAP43, ARSB, PER1, GUSB, and MAPT. Additional top blood biomarkers include GSK3B, PTGS2, APOE, BACE1, PSEN1, and TREM2, well known genes implicated in AD by previous brain and genetic studies, in humans and animal models, which serve as reassuring de facto positive controls for our whole-genome gene expression discovery approach. Biological pathway analyses implicate LXR/RXR activation, neuroinflammation, atherosclerosis signaling, and amyloid processing. Co-directionality of expression data provide new mechanistic insights that are consistent with a compensatory/scarring scenario for brain pathological changes. A majority of top biomarkers also have evidence for involvement in other psychiatric disorders, particularly stress, providing a molecular basis for clinical co-morbidity and for stress as an early precipitant/risk factor.

However, the origin of EEG spikes in transgenic AD model mice has remained elusive, which makes it difficult to relate electrophysiology with underlying pathology at the cellular and molecular level. Using multiple cortical and subcortical electrodes in freely moving APP/PS1 transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates, we identified several types of epileptic spikes among over 15 800 spikes visible with cortical screw electrodes based on their source localization. Cortical spikes associated with muscle twitches, cortico-hippocampal spikes, and spindle and fast-spindle associated spikes were present equally often in both APP/PS1 and wild-type mice, whereas pure cortical spikes were slightly more common in APP/PS1 mice. In contrast, spike-wave discharges, cortico-hippocampal spikes with after hyperpolarization and giant spikes were seen almost exclusively in APP/PS1 mice but only in a subset of them.

As in AD patients, they occurred exclusively during sleep. Further, we could demonstrate that a high number of giant spikes in APP/PS1 mice predicts seizures. These data show that by only adding a pair of hippocampal deep electrodes and EMG to routine cortical epidural screw electrodes and by taking into account underlying cortical oscillations, one can drastically refine the analysis of cortical spike data.

This causes loss of microtubule stability and in turn alters axonal integrity. In the present work, emphasis towards understanding interaction of nickel with Tau was made. Metals such as iron, zinc, copper and lead etc., are known to modulate Tau conformation and enhance its aggregation. Our results showed the deliverance of Tau aggregation by nickel and its synthetic morpholine conjugate. Nickel prevents aggregation by inducing degradation of Tau as evidenced by SDS-PAGE and TEM. Nickel and the synthetic conjugate being non-toxic to neuro2a cells and prevent Tau aggregation, might direct these complexes to overcome AD."], "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh_terms": ["Alzheimer Diseasepathology", "Neurofibrillary Tanglesdrug effects", "Nickelpharmacology", "Protein Aggregatesdrug effects", "tau Proteinschemistry"]}, "31770379": {"ArticleTitle": "Altered expression of Notch1 in Alzheimer's disease.", "AbstractText": ["Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that regulates cell-cell interactions through binding of Notch family receptors to their cognate ligands.

Mice were chronically prepared with a cranial window through which 2-Dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS) was used to generate functional maps of the cerebral blood volume and saturation changes evoked by whisker stimulation and vascular reactivity challenges. Unexpectedly, the hemodynamic responses were largely preserved in the J20-AD group. This result failed to confirm previous investigations using the J20-AD model. However, a final acute electrophysiology and 2D-OIS experiment was performed to measure both neural and hemodynamic responses concurrently. In this experiment, previously reported deficits in neurovascular coupling in the J20-AD model were observed. This suggests that J20-AD mice may be more susceptible to the physiologically stressing conditions of an acute experimental procedure compared to WT animals.

Scientists have discovered that the causes of AD may include a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors, but the exact cause has not yet been elucidated. Effective strategies to prevent and treat AD therefore remain elusive. The identified genetic causes of AD mainly focus on individual genes, but growing evidence has shown that complex diseases are usually affected by the interaction of genes in a network. Few studies have focused on the interactions and correlations between genes and how they are gradually destroyed or disappear during AD progression. A differential network analysis has been recognized as an essential tool for identifying the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and significant genes for prediction analysis. We therefore aim to conduct a differential network analysis to reveal potential networks involved in the neuropathogenesis of AD and identify genes for AD prediction. Methods: In this paper, we selected 365 samples from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, including 193 clinically and neuropathologically confirmed AD subjects and 172 no cognitive impairment (NCI) controls. Then, we selected 158 genes belonging to the AD pathway (hsa05010) of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.

While there is no consensus regarding the synaptic-relevant species of A\u03b2, it is known that A\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2Os) are noticeably increased in the early stages of AD, localizing at or within the synapse. In cell and animal models, A\u03b2Os have been shown to attach to synapses and instigate synapse dysfunction and deterioration. To establish the pathological mechanism of synaptic loss in AD, it will be important to identify the synaptic targets to which A\u03b2Os attach. Methods: An unbiased approach using far western ligand blots has identified three synaptic proteins to which A\u03b2Os specifically attach. These proteins (p100, p140, and p260) were subsequently enriched by detergent extraction, ultracentrifugation, and CHT-HPLC column separation, and sequenced by LC-MS/MS. P100, p140, and p260 were identified. These levels of A\u03b2Os targets in human AD and aging frontal cortexes were analyzed by quantitative proteomics and western-blot. The polyclonal antibody to A\u03b2Os was developed and used to block the toxicity of A\u03b2Os. The data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance. Results: A\u03b2Os binding proteins p100, p140, and p260 were identified as Na/K-ATPase, synGap, and Shank3, respectively. \u03b13-Na/K-ATPase, synGap, and Shank3 proteins showed loss in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of human AD frontal cortex. In short term experiments, oligomers of A\u03b2 inhibited Na/K-ATPase at the synapse. Na/K-ATPase activity was restored by an antibody specific for soluble forms of A\u03b2. \u03b13-Na/K-ATPase protein and synaptic \u03b2-amyloid peptides were pulled down from human AD synapses by co-immunoprecipitation. Results suggest synaptic dysfunction in early stages of AD may stem from inhibition of Na/K-ATPase activity by A\u03b2 oligomers, while later stages could hypothetically result from disrupted synapse structure involving the PSD proteins synGap and Shank3. Conclusion: We identified three A\u03b2O binding proteins as \u03b13-Na/K-ATPase, synGap, and Shank3.
